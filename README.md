# **CMS Detector Physics Enthusiast's Playground**

## **Welcome!**

Hello! I'm from Poland, and my heart races with particles moving at the speed of light. This repository is my corner where I blend my passion for programming with the fascinating world of particle physics. I work with the **CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector**, one of the key instruments at CERN, allowing us to delve into the deepest secrets of the universe.

## **What You'll Find Here**

- **Analytical Scripts**: Tools and scripts that aid in analyzing data collected by the CMS detector.
- **Physics Simulations**: Models and simulations to help understand particle behavior under various conditions.
- **Research Projects**: Documentation and source code of the projects I'm working on, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.

Join me in exploring the incredible world of particle physics, one line of code at a time. Let's uncover the mysteries of the universe together!
