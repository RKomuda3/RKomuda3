##Welcome to My Repository!
Hello! I'm from Poland, and my heart races with particles moving at the speed of light. This repository is my corner where I blend my passion for programming with the fascinating world of particle physics. I work with the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector, one of the key instruments at CERN, allowing us to delve into the deepest secrets of the universe.
